Clustering Customer Behavior Based on E-commerce Event Data

In a modern e-commerce platform, understanding customer behavior is critical for optimizing user experience and increasing sales. The provided dataset contains information about user interactions with various products on the platform, including event types, product categories, brands, prices, and user sessions.
This is an unsupervised machine learning problem aimed at uncovering hidden patterns in user behavior to group similar users or actions. These insights could assist in personalizing user experiences, targeting advertisements, or improving product recommendations.

For this problem statement you can use complete data and cluster it to find top themes.
Provide your solution which consists of:
-	Data Cleaning & preprocessing
-	Features selected.
-	Clustering and number of clusters identified /suggested by you as Data Scientist
-	Evaluation of model
-	Insights for Business

Use the “ecommerce_behavior”’ table from the Clustering.db file for the project.
